# AnimVR Unity Toolkit
This packages allows you to drag the .stage files you create with [AnimVR](https://nvrmind.io/#animvr) into [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com) and treat them like any other asset.

## Main Features

- Import complete stages, including animation, meshes, textures, cameras and sound.
- Use the Unity Timeline API to playback animations, do scene transitions and integrate it with the rest of your game/movie.
- Create new stages directly in the Unity Editor and open them in AnimVR. When you save, the changes are instantly visible in Unity.
